                                           INTRODUCTION
Each year the Secretariat of Divine Worship of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops
publishes the Liturgical Calendar for the Dioceses of the United States of America. This
calendar is used by authors of ordines and other liturgical aids published to foster the celebration
of the liturgy in our country.

The calendar is based upon the General Roman Calendar, promulgated by Pope Paul VI on
February 14, 1969, subsequently amended by Pope John Paul II, and the Proper Calendar for the
Dioceses of the United States of America, approved by the United States Conference of Catholic
Bishops.1 This calendar has been updated to reflect the names and titles of the various liturgical
days in conformity with the Roman Missal, Third Edition.

The General Instruction of the Roman Missal reminds us that in the cycles of readings and
prayers proclaimed throughout the year in the sacred liturgy “the mysteries of redemption are
celebrated so as to be in some way made present.” Thus may each celebration of the Holy
Eucharist which is served by this calendar be for the Church in the United States of America “the
high point both of the action by which God sanctifies the world in Christ and of the worship that
the human race offers to the Father, adoring him through Christ, the Son of God, in the Holy
Spirit.”2

                                                         Sincerely in Christ,



                                                         Rev. Msgr. Richard B. Hilgartner
                                                         Executive Director

  For the significance of the several grades or kinds of celebrations, the norms of the Roman Calendar should be
consulted (cf. Liturgy Documentary Series 6: Norms Governing Liturgical Calendars, Washington, DC: USCC,
1984). For information concerning the choice of texts and formularies, the General Instruction of the Roman Missal
and the Introduction to the 1998 revised Lectionary for Mass (cf. Liturgy Documentary Series 1: Lectionary for
Mass, Introduction, Washington, DC: USCC, 1998) should be consulted.

                        CYCLES — LECTIONARY FOR MASS

        Sunday Cycle      YEAR A        December 1, 2013 to November 23, 2014
        Weekday Cycle     CYCLE 2       January 13, 2014 to March 4, 2014
                                        June 9, 2014 to November 29, 2014
        Sunday Cycle      YEAR B        November 30, 2014 to November 22, 2015



The cycles given above have been used in the preparation of this Calendar. The readings from
the Proper of Time and Proper of Saints have been used for all Solemnities and all Feasts since
they must take the place of the weekday readings for those respective days. The readings from
the weekday cycle generally are to be used even on days on which a Memorial or Optional
Memorial of a Saint occurs. The exceptions to this rule are the Memorials or Optional
Memorials which have “proper readings” (usually only the Gospel) assigned to them in the
Lectionary for Mass. These readings are marked with an asterisk (*) and must be used on those
days. Substitutions from the Proper of Saints or from the Commons may be made for the other
readings suggested for those Memorials or Optional Memorials. The Priest Celebrant, however,
should not omit too often or without sufficient cause the readings assigned for each day in the
weekday cycle (see the Introduction to the Lectionary for Mass, no. 83). In this Calendar,
Optional Memorials are designated by brackets.

The Scripture citations and Lectionary numbers for all readings are from the Lectionary for Mass
for Use in the Dioceses of the United States of America, second typical edition (1998), which is
based on the Ordo Lectionum Missæ, editio typica altera (1981). The spellings of the names of
Saints and Blesseds are from the Roman Missal, Third Edition (2011), based on the Missale
Romanum, editio typica tertia emendata (2008).

                                MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
1. The 2014 liturgical year begins on the First Sunday of Advent, December 1, 2013.

2. Scripture citations are based on the New American Bible with the revised New Testament and
   may differ slightly from the citations given in the Ordo Lectionum Missæ (1981) due to
   difference in versification.

3. In the preparation of diocesan and provincial Calendars and ordines, the dedication of
   diocesan cathedrals, the dedication of parish churches, and special days of prayer (cf.
   General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 373) should be added, along with other
   commemorations of Saints and Blesseds which are included in those particular Calendars.

4. In several ecclesiastical provinces of the United States of America, the Solemnity of the
   Ascension of the Lord is transferred from May 29, 2014, to the following Sunday, June 1,
   2014. In those archdioceses and dioceses, Thursday, May 29, 2014, is observed as an Easter
   Weekday.

5. Outside Advent, Christmas Time, Lent, and Easter Time, on Saturdays which have no
   commemoration having the rank of Obligatory Memorial or higher, a Mass in honor of the
   Blessed Virgin Mary may be celebrated. This is indicated in the calendar by “BVM.” The
   readings and prayers may be selected from the Collection of Masses of the Blessed Virgin
   Mary.

6. In a decree dated March 23, 1992, the Bishop of Honolulu designated Christmas and the
   Immaculate Conception as the only two Holydays of Obligation for the State of Hawaii. This
   implements the indult received from the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline
   of the Sacraments on May 26, 1990, and the subsequent nihil obstat from the National
   Conference of Catholic Bishops allowing Hawaii to legislate on this matter in accord with the
   policies of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific (CEPAC).



                                               6
7. In a notification dated December 8, 1998 of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the
   Discipline of the Sacraments (Prot. n. 2671/98/L), the Obligatory Memorial of the
   Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary becomes an Optional Memorial in years when
   it conflicts with another Obligatory Memorial. Therefore, Saturday, June 28, 2014, is a
   weekday in Ordinary Time, as well as the Optional Memorials of the Immaculate Heart of
   the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint Irenaeus, Bishop and Martyr.

8. Since December 8, 2013, is the Third Sunday of Advent, the Solemnity of the Immaculate
   Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary is transferred to Monday, December 9, 2013. The
   obligation to attend Mass, however, does not transfer. The Optional Memorial of Saint Juan
   Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin, December 9, is omitted this year.

  Nine readings are assigned to the Easter Vigil: seven from the Old Testament and two from the New. If
circumstances demand in individual cases, the number of prescribed readings may be reduced. Three selections
from the Old Testament, both from the Law and the Prophets, should be read before the Epistle and Gospel. In any
case, the reading from Exodus about the escape through the Red Sea (reading 3) should never be omitted.
